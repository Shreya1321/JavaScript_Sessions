        <p>Tom and Jerry is an American animated franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.</p>
        <p>
          Ok, we all know who this guy is. It is a tomcat, a male cat - hence the simple name Tom. 
          
          Did you know that his name when he first appeared was Jasper. Not cool, right? Tom is much much better.
          
          He's just a plain houshold cat that sleeps most of the day, and when he does not sleep, he tries to eat something nice - cheese, maybe a bottle of milk. 
          
          He would probably lead boring life if he lived alone. But he is not alone. There is a little mouse who lives under the same roof who just won't let him be.</p>
          <p>
            Little brown mouse with a typical American name is called Jerry. It is probably stupid to introduce you with the most famous cartoon characters in the world. Kids who live in the coolest parts of Alaska, or the driest part of Sahara desert, or the rain forests of Brasil, probably they all already know who Tom and Jerry were. 

To cut the long story short, Jerry is sharing food with Tom and most of the time that is a big problem for Tom. Better word instead of sharing would be stealing. Well, what can he do. People keep cats as pets mostly. They don't like mice that much. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Love and Hate, at the same time. These two guys are basically friends, as they have a great time trying to trick one another. It all looks extremely violent at first sight, but really it's not. Nobody ever got hurt. 
Everything they do to each other is more like having a blasts of fun as everything goes well for them at the end. Tom and Jerry relationship is actually quite complicated, there's an interesting post right here.
Kids, no matter how young, realize it's all fake and not for real.
